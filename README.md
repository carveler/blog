# Flask Blog Application

## Overview
This Flask Blog Application is a simple web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. It uses Flask, a micro web framework written in Python, to handle server-side operations.

## Features
- Create new blog posts with a title, author, and content.
- View a list of all blog posts on the main page.
- Update existing blog posts.
- Delete blog posts.
- Increment 'likes' for a blog post.

## Usage

To start the application, you will need Python and Flask installed on your system. If you do not have these, you can download and install Python from python.org and Flask using pip:

```bash
pip3 install Flask
```

To start the application, navigate to the applicationâ€™s directory in the terminal and run:

```bash
python app.py
```
This will start a local server, and the application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default.
